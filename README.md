# Project: Find Movie Similarity from Plot Summaries

Use NLP and clustering on movie plot summaries from IMDb and Wikipedia to quantify movie similarity.

**Project Description:**

We all love watching movies! There are some movies we like, some we don't. Most people have a preference for movies of a similar genre. Some of us love watching action movies, while some of us like watching horror. Some of us like watching movies that have ninjas in them, while some of us like watching superheroes.

In this notebook, we will quantify the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb and Wikipedia, then separate them into groups, also known as clusters. We'll create a dendrogram to represent how closely the movies are related to each other.

This project is my work on guided project section on DataCamp.
